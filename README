# This is a personal project meant to be a virtual machine capable of interpreting
# the TINY Language assembly instructions described by Kenneth Louden in his book
# Compiler Construction, Principles and Practice. The ablity to see how stack
# memory is manipulated at runtime will greatly ease the work of optimizing a
# compiler for the C- (C minus) language. The code is client side only.
# 
# The current version is (should be) hosted as http://burningpotato.com/tm
# If you just want to try it out, skip down to the SAMPLE PROGRAM, which is heapsort.


# INSTALLING
#
# This program is tested with jQuery 1.7.1 and  jQuery UI 1.8.17.
# You will need to modify the links in the document header to point the 
# versions of these libraries that you have. For jQuery UI, you need a
# build with at least the Button, Dialog, Slider, and Tabs widgets (to be safe).
# There is no server component to the VM, it should run on any platform in any
# web browser.
